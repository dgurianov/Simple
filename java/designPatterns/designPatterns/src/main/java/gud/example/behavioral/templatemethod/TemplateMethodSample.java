/*
The Template Method pattern is quite common in Java frameworks. Developers often use it to provide framework users with a
simple means of extending standard functionality using inheritance.
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and
let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithmâ€™s structure.
